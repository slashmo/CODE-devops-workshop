# CODE DevOps Workshop: Clouds, Containers and CI/CD
## Summary
This workshop will be a mixture of interactive learning and hands-on practical work, so come prepared to get your hands dirty! In this workshop we will:
* Use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch and use compute resources in the Cloud
* Run a Jenkins Continuous Integration (CI) server as a Docker container ([jenkins-code](https://github.com/mrmaxsteel/jenkins-code)) on an AWS instance
* Set up a CI/CD pipeline for a GitHub repository, so you can have automated Build, Test and Deploy, each time you commit
* Practise some TDD on a Python application, and see how it interacts with the CI system 

Prior to the workshop, please complete the [Pre-Work](#pre-work)
